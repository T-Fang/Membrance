**Gameplay Features:**

- Memory-Driven Progression: As you retrieve pieces of your memory, the world begins to change. Levels become distorted, overlaid with visuals and mechanics from other dimensions, blending beauty and chaos.
- Dynamic Level Design: Each reclaimed memory alters the world’s design, adding new environmental hazards, mechanics, or visual overlays, reflecting the fragmented nature of your identity.
- Combat & Exploration: Engage in fast-paced combat against a variety of unique enemies while navigating intricate, puzzle-like platforming challenges.
- Unraveling the Truth: The more memories you regain, the more you uncover unsettling truths about your past and the origin of the Demon King’s power.

**Narrative Twist:**
Recovering your memories may not be the salvation you hoped for. The corruption seems to intensify with every step closer to the Demon King. Is defeating him truly the solution, or is there something more sinister lurking beneath the surface?
